    <setup>
        <migrate_command>
            To set up the project's database, run the following command:
            ```
            php artisan migrate
            ```
            This command will execute all the pending database migrations.
        </migrate_command>

        <server_command>
            To run the Laravel development server, use the following command:
            ```
            php artisan serve
            ```
            This will start the server at http://localhost:8000.
        </server_command>

        <env_configuration>
            Before running the project, make sure to set up the .env file. Rename the .env.example file to .env and update the following configurations:

            ```
            APP_NAME=Task Management
            APP_ENV=local
            APP_KEY=YOUR_APP_KEY
            APP_DEBUG=true
            APP_URL=http://localhost

            DB_CONNECTION=mysql
            DB_HOST=YOUR_DB_HOST
            DB_PORT=YOUR_DB_PORT
            DB_DATABASE=YOUR_DB_NAME
            DB_USERNAME=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
            DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
            ```

            Set the `APP_KEY` to a unique 32-character string. Fill in the database connection details according to your setup. Save the changes and then run the migration command to set up the database.

            Note: Ensure that your server meets the minimum requirements for running Laravel.
